# Face Detection using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

This repository contains my implementation for face detection using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) Features. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) method is a popular technique for detecting objects, including faces, in images.
This code is implemented in Python 3.

### Steps involved in the process:  

**HOG Feature Extraction:** Extracts Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features from images.  

**Sliding Window Technique:** Employs a sliding window approach to search for potential face locations in the target image.  

**Thresholding and Non-maximal Suppression:** Implements thresholding and non-maximal suppression techniques to filter out false positives and refine detected face bounding boxes.
